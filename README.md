# diffy-q-problem-solution-sets
 This repository contains an archive of ~110 pages of problem and solution sets for 15+ types of differential equations/solution techniques, typset in LaTeX that I used for my MATH 3400 Supplemental Instruction course

## Notes:
- If there are any errors, please feel free to let me know.
- These problems are gathered from various standard differential equations textbooks, and in some cases, have been altered slightly.
- These problems only cover the content that is present in MATH 3400 at Ohio University by a particular professor.
- The \implies symbol in LaTeX is, very likely improperly, used as a symbol to denote the progression of steps in the solutions to problems.
- Any TiKz figures should be assumed to not belong to me. Proper credit will be added in future commits.
